## 👨🏻‍💻 Who am i ?

I’m Erwan, a **24-year-old software engineer** based in France. My daily goal is to improve myself as an engineer, and I enjoy solving problems by finding pragmatic and efficient solutions. I love learning new things and working on research projects.

## 🐠📱 Fishbotica

I'm part of an amazing project called Fishbotica. We're on a mission to make aquarium keeping accessible to both beginners and experts.
The project is still in its early stages, but is incubated at Nausicaá and actively followed by them. Join us on social media to be part of the adventure!
